#### 1. There are a lot of problems with carbon credits (see the range in pricing from $3/ton to $40/ton)

#### 2. "Carbon credits" are a proxy for carbon sequestered. But per point 1, that proxy is wildly inconsistent.

Instead of carbon credits, what if we based carbon accounting on estimations of carbon stock in a given piece of land?

So if a company wanted to offset 1 ton of CO2, they would have to purchase a parcel of land that they believe holds 1 ton of CO2.

The carbon in that land is an asset on their balance sheet. If a wildfire comes along and burns up the land, they lose all the carbon on their balance sheet. If the company and local farmers work to improve the carbon sequestration of that piece of land, the carbon on their balance sheet increases.

So this would give "carbon buyers" and land stewards a skin in the game and shared incentive over sequestering more, permanent carbon in the long run

Land that we believe holds carbon more permanently (e.g. mineral rock) would be seen as less risky/more valuable, and land that we believe holds carbon less permanently would be seen as more risky/less valuable.

So there would still be variability in pricing in the carbon market - but it wouldn't be based on an unenforced concept of "quality", as with carbon credits today. It would be based on buyer's risk tolerance - understanding that if you buy carbon which has less permanence, your asset has less permanence
